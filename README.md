# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my learning journey and practice code for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++.

## Patterns

The repository also includes common patterns that are useful in solving DSA problems:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing Techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC or an IDE like Visual Studio Code or CLion.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-in-Cpp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired topic folder, e.g., Arrays:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-in-Cpp/Arrays
   ```

3. Compile the C++ file using a compiler like `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ array_basics.cpp -o array_basics
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./array_basics
   ```
